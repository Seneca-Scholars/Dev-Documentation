# Communication Scenarios & Templates

Effective communication is essential in school projects, technical teams, and internships. This guide provides templates and scenarios for:

- Asking for help when stuck
- Giving status updates
- Requesting extensions
- Giving heads-up notices
- Notifying team members of progress or blockers

---

## Scenario 1: You're Stuck on a Coding Problem

**Goal:** Be specific, respectful, and clear.

**Template:**

> Hi [Name], I’ve been working on [brief task description] and I’m running into a blocker with [describe the issue briefly].  
>  
> I’ve tried [X, Y, Z], but I’m still stuck. Do you have a moment to take a look or guide me toward a next step?

**Example:**

> Hey Sarah, I’m trying to get the login modal to trigger on failed auth, but the error isn't being caught by the handler.  
>  
> I checked the async calls and even console-logged the state, but still can’t pinpoint it. Could you help me debug this later today?

---

## Scenario 2: Giving a Heads-Up About a Delay or Absence

**Goal:** Be transparent and proactive.

**Template:**

> Hi [Name], just a quick heads-up—I might need more time on [task] due to [reason].  
>  
> I’ll make sure to update by [date/time], and let you know if anything changes. Let me know if you need a backup plan in place.

**Example:**

> Hey Jordan, I may not finish the styling pass on the dashboard tonight—still working through some responsive layout bugs.  
>  
> I’ll push what I have by 10 PM and let you know where things stand.

## Scenario 3: You're Falling Behind on a School Project

**Goal:** Take responsibility and offer a path forward.

**Template:**

> Hey [Teammates/Prof], I wanted to be honest—I’ve been struggling to keep up with [part of the project].  
>  
> I can take on extra work this weekend to catch up, or swap roles if that helps the team stay on track.  
>  
> Let me know how I can help.

**Example:**

> Hey team, I’ve been falling behind on the API docs this week due to some personal stuff.  
>  
> I’ll clear up my Saturday and finish it then—let me know if anything urgent needs shifting.

## Scenario 4: Giving Status Updates to a Manager

**Goal:** Be concise, outcome-oriented, and aligned with expectations.

**Template:**

> Hi [Manager], quick update:  
> ✅ [Task completed]  
> 🔧 [Task in progress] – expected by [date]  
> ⚠️ [Blocker] – investigating / need support

**Example:**

> Hey Wajiw, quick update:  
> ✅ Set up initial schema  
> 🔧 Hooking up POST route for project creation — should finish today  
> ⚠️ Still debugging edge case for guest sessions (will loop back in once I trace it)

---

## Scenario 5: Proactively Asking for Feedback

**Goal:** Invite clarity or review without pressure.

**Template:**

> Hey [Name], when you have a moment, could you review [PR/task/file]?  
>  
> Would appreciate your thoughts on [specific part if any].

**Example:**

> Hi Alex, could you take a quick look at the layout changes I pushed? I’m trying to make sure the mobile grid logic makes sense.

## General Tips

- **Be specific:** Mention what’s done, what’s pending, and what’s unclear.
- **Be honest:** It's better to flag issues early than silently struggle.
- **Be respectful of time:** Offer async options or small windows for discussion.
- **Own your voice:** You don’t need to be perfect—just clear and reliable.

## Closing

Knowing how to communicate effectively—especially when things go wrong—is a professional skill. Use these patterns, tweak the tone based on the situation, and always aim for clarity over perfection.
